Climate Science is a field of study that is concerned with understanding the complex physical processes that determine the Earth’s climate, and their interactions. A deeper understanding of the Earth system then helps in producing accurate and useful predictions of variables such as temperature and precipitation on various timescales, and subsequently heat waves, flooding, drought, and other high-impact phenomena. Moreover, rising atmospheric temperature have caused increases in land and ocean temperatures, melting of glaciers and sea-ice, sea-level rise, and more frequent and extreme weather events. Such extreme events not only have significant economic cost, but are a force behind geo-political issues. For example, in 2021 the 20 biggest weather-related disasters in the United States killed more than 600 people and cost \$\145 billion, with \$\75 billion of that coming from Hurricane Ida itself. Therefore, along with the pure scientific research, the scientific community is now turning its attention towards decision-relevant climate science that helps in understanding and prediction of such extreme events on timescales from days to several years. This “actionable climate science” is of particular importance to stakeholders (e.g., nations, states, city planners, water managers) when making both real-time and long-term decisions. However, several factors exacerbate the difficulty of this work, such as the highly uncertain nature of day-to-day weather, inadequate knowledge of the underlying physics, lack of observational data, imperfect climate models, and limited computing power. 
I work broadly in the area of weather and climate extremes (e.g., rainfall and temperature extremes). More specifically, my research focuses on the processes that lead to extreme rainfall and temperature events, detection and attribution of climate change, decadal predictability, future climate projections, estimation of future intensity, duration, frequency (IDF) curves of precipitation, climate model evaluation, and co-production of actionable climate science. My research can be broadly divided into the following categories.

Global and Regional Climate Model Evaluation
======
While climate models generally predict an increase in the global mean precipitation in response to a human-caused increase in greenhouse gases, the response of both the mean and extreme precipitation is much more uncertain on local to regional scales. Moreover, the sign and magnitude of change in the mean precipitation may differ from that in the extreme precipitation. Depending upon the changing characteristics of precipitation, a region may face both an increased risk of flooding and drought.  Since these extreme changes in precipitation character have implications for impact, adaption, and vulnerability, there has been growing demand from local stakeholders (e.g., water managers) for reliable future projections of both mean and extreme precipitation on fine spatial scales (of the order of a few kilometers). However, these projections have significant uncertainty because of insufficient observational data, lack of complete knowledge of precipitation-related physical mechanisms, imperfect regional climate models, lack of computing power, etc. From the stakeholders’ perspective of impact, adaption, and vulnerability, work is needed to develop new metrics for evaluating regional climate models, using those metrics for projecting future changes in precipitation, and finding new methods to reduce projection uncertainty.  In a series of publications, I have analyzed precipitation and its mean and extreme ETCCDI indices in recently available global and regional climate models. My analysis suggests that the models have made some progress in simulating precipitation quantities, but their performance varies spatially and temporally.

Figure caption: Portrait diagrams of normalized RMSEs in the 1981–2005 climatologies of indices. For an index the normalized RMSE (NRMSE) is computed by normalizing the respective RMSE with respect to the median of RMSEs across CMIP6 models as shown in Eqn. (2). For a dataset the MCI shown in the top row of each panel is the median of NRMSEs over all indices for that dataset. NRMSE is unitless.
