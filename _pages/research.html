Rising atmospheric temperature have caused increases in land and ocean temperatures, melting of glaciers and sea-ice, sea-level rise, 
and more frequent and extreme weather events such as flooding, droughts, and heatwaves. 
Such extreme events not only have significant economic cost, but are a force behind geo-political issues. 
Therefore, along with the pure scientific research, the scientific community is now turning its attention towards decision-relevant
climate science that helps in understanding and prediction of such extreme events on timescales from days to several years. 
This “actionable climate science” is of particular importance to stakeholders (e.g., nations, city planners, water managers)
when making both real-time and long-term decisions. However, several factors exacerbate the difficulty of this work, 
such as the highly uncertain nature of day-to-day weather, inadequate knowledge of the underlying physics, lack of observational data,
imperfect climate models, and limited computing power. 
I work broadly in the area of weather and climate extremes (e.g., rainfall and temperature extremes).
More specifically, my research focuses on the processes that lead to extreme rainfall and temperature events, 
detection and attribution of climate change, decadal predictability, future climate projections,
estimation of future intensity, duration, frequency (IDF) curves of precipitation, climate model evaluation, 
and co-production of actionable climate science. My research can be broadly divided into the following categories.  


<h2>Global and Regional Climate Model Evaluation</h2>

While climate models generally predict an increase in the global mean precipitation in response to a human-caused increase in greenhouse gases, 
the response of both the mean and extreme precipitation is much more uncertain on local to regional scales. Stakeholders need reliable future projections 
of precipitation.
<!-- Moreover, the sign and magnitude of change in the mean precipitation may differ from that in the extreme precipitation. 
Depending upon the changing characteristics of precipitation, a region may face both an increased risk of flooding and drought.   
 Since these extreme changes in precipitation character have implications for impact, adaption, and vulnerability, 
there has been growing demand from local stakeholders (e.g., water managers) for reliable future projections of both mean and extreme precipitation
on fine spatial scales (of the order of a few kilometers). -->
However, the projections of precipitation have significant uncertainty because of insufficient observational data, 
lack of complete knowledge of precipitation-related physical mechanisms, imperfect regional climate models, etc. 
<!--From the stakeholders’ perspective of impact, adaption, and vulnerability, work is needed to develop new metrics for evaluating regional climate models,
using those metrics for projecting future changes in precipitation, and finding new methods to reduce projection uncertainty. -->
In a series of publications, I have analyzed precipitation and its mean and extreme ETCCDI indices in recently available global
and regional climate models. My analysis suggests that the models have made some progress in simulating precipitation quantities,
but their performance varies spatially and temporally.

<h2>Reduction of uncertainty in intensity, duration and frequency (IDF) curves of precipitation</h2>
  
Traditional multimodel methods for estimating future changes in precipitation intensity, duration, and frequency (IDF) curves rely
  on mean or median of models’ IDF estimates. Such multimodel estimates are impaired  by large estimation uncertainty due to small
  sample size. My research shows that pooling model data can reduce bias and uncertainty in IDF estimates.

  <div align="left"><h2>Detection and attribution, and Future climate Projections</h2></div>  
  Reliable projections of future climate is a challenging problem because of small signal-to-noise ratio (SNR),
  attributed to large internal variability; and  lack of fine resolution climate information. Inspired by these limitations, my research involves (i) the application of sophisticated 
  statistical techniques that can maximize SNR and thus detect robust patterns of future changes in climate, and (ii) the use of state-of-the-art,
  cutting-edge regional climate models that can refine information at regional scales.
