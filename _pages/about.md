I am an Assistant Project Scientist in the Department of Land, Air and Water Resources at the University of California, Davis, USA. I work on a broad range of research areas pertaining to weather and climate extremes. Specifically, my research focuses on understanding the processes that lead to extreme precipitation and temperature events; exploring methods to reduce uncertainty in future projections of extremes; quantifying future changes in precipitation intensity-duration frequency (IDF) curves; detection & attribution of natural and human influences on extremes; decadal predictability; the innovative use of metrics for climate model evaluation; and co-production of actionable climate science. To perform this research, I am funded by the two United States Department of Energy (US-DOE) projects, [HyperFACETS](https://hyperfacets.ucdavis.edu/) and [CASCADE](https://cascade.lbl.gov/). In the  HyperFACETS project, my research is focused on producing decision-relevant hydroclimate information through metric-based model evaluation and projection, exploring methods to reduce uncertainties in future projections, and large-scale patterns associated with the precipitation extremes. In the CASCADE project, I work on the detection and attribution of heat extremes and understanding the processes that lead to those extremes.
