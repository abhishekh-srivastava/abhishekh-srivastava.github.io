I am an Assistant Project Scientist in the Department of Land, Air and Water Resources at the University of California, Davis, USA. I work on a broad range of research areas pertaining to weather and climate extremes. Specifically, my research focuses on understanding the processes that lead to extreme precipitation and temperature events; exploring methods to reduce uncertainty in future projections of extremes; quantifying future changes in precipitation intensity-duration frequency (IDF) curves; detection & attribution of natural and human influences on extremes; decadal predictability; the innovative use of metrics for climate model evaluation; and co-production of actionable climate science. To perform this research, I am funded by the two United States Department of Energy (US-DOE) projects, [HyperFACETS](https://climatemodeling.science.energy.gov/projects/framework-improving-analysis-and-modeling-earth-system-and-intersectoral-dynamics-regional) and [CASCADE](https://climatemodeling.science.energy.gov/projects/calibrated-and-systematic-characterization-attribution-and-detection-extremes-cascade). In the The HyperFACETS project, my research is focused on producing decision-relevant hydroclimate informaton through metric-based model evaluation and projection, exploring methods to reduce uncertainties in futuer projections, large scale patterns associated woth the precipitation extremes. In the CASCADE project, I work on the detection and attribution of heat extremes and understaning the process that lead to heat extremes.

Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
